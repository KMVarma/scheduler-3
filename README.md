# CS 4269/5269 Team 3 Course Scheduler

We built a recursive, backtracking course planner. We employ a two-stage solution with a course finder and a schedule planner. We then implemented course macros and various improvements to handle requirements intricacies not explicitly encoded by the course dictionary. A performance increase was observed when with the presence of the improvements. We solved the elective satisfaction problem with a unique general solution.
